C vs Python
250 words

Personally, I have been coding and learning Python for around 4 months already and also had some experience with coding in C. Python is obviously an easier choice overall compared to C as it uses language we all understand and is an overall simplified version of all the languages combined. For example, basic print functions could be done in Python by simply typing print(“Hello World”), however in C to print “hello world” we have to first specify the void of the program with “void setup()”, and use “{“ or “}” to specify the domain and finally use the print function by typing “printf(“Hello World”); return 0;”. 

To cut it short, C is a structured oriented programming language and Python is an object-oriented programming language. For example, C is used to program the basic functionalities of a computer on a hardware level, making it faster and less power-hungry compared to Python. On the other hand, Python is used to program the basics on a software level, making it overall slower and more power-hungry compared to C. With Python being an easier programming language to master, it has its own drawbacks requiring a more powerful machine and with less overall power. 

Even though C is a harder language to master, I feel like, with the practice from Python and pseudocode, I will be able to learn and master C relatively quickly and understand the key concepts of C.
