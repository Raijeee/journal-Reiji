# Task 1: Prototypes and client interaction
## Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

In my opinion, I think the client should be involved from the start. This will include a weekly update of the progress of the program which will give them a rough understanding of our progress, and also makes sure the client is satisfied with what we are creating. By also giving the client a weekly update, it prevents us from procrastinating as we have to show progress weekly to the client. 

## Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

I think in this game it is a necessity to create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). As I am making an adventure game with numerous outcomes, the first “skateboard” or the first stage of the MVP could include the themes of the game and perhaps the possible outcomes of the games. This will help me understand what kind of game the client wants and even the genre of the game.

## Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

Both Human centered and the design cycle focuses on the feedback the object or in our case, the software gives. Both cycles focuses on the client and what they are meant to see as a result of their input. For example the flat handles on a door is a clear indication of a “push” and the same can go with our software where we indicate the user with the “print” function to give orders and a guidance of what the user should input and what they should expect. 

## Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

An example of the simplest principles of human centered design include doors and computers. For example, the door can have a visual indication or a physical limitation to indicate or limit the user with only one input, “push” or “pull”. The door could include an obvious handle to indicate “pull” and a flat metallic side to indicate “push”. Additionally, computers have keyboards that have English letters on them, and with the help of software on the laptop, it gives the user a clear thinking path of what they should expect from this piece of metal.
